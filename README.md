# ai-coroner
This script was created to increase immersion in growing cities. Whenever a player or npc dies, an ai coroner will arrive to take care of the body and clear the scene afterwards. This script is auto set to disable for PLAYERS when job 'ambulance' is on duty. NPC will still be treated and removed.
